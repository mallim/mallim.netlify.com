Pipeline and Chain of Reponsiblity both look quite similar to me. 

## Pipeline:

* [Pipeline pattern - Plumber quest](http://qrman.github.io/posts/2017/02/09/pipeline-pattern-plumber-quest) - got an example here
* [Function composition and the Collection Pipeline pattern](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-java8idioms2/index.html) 
- it shows how you can transform multiple for loops to a functional ones

## Chain of Responsiblility:

* [commons-chain2-poc](https://github.com/sawestwood/commons-chain2-poc) - Apache Commons Chain implements the Chain of Responsibility pattern, 
  this github gives a history of commons-chain. There is actually a tutorial on [Baeldung](http://www.baeldung.com/apache-commons-chain)

Guess what I stumbled upon when I am looking around? [Design patterns implemented in Java](http://java-design-patterns.com/)
