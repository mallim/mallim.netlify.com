## Changes as of 2019-06-15

- Added a brand new README.md by using [readme-md-generator](https://github.com/kefranabg/readme-md-generator)

## Changes as of 2019-06-11

- Added [Gridsome Remark Twitter](https://gridsome.org/plugins/gridsome-plugin-remark-twitter)
- Removed [gridsome-plugin-remark-youtube](https://github.com/markhoney/gridsome-plugin-remark-youtube) because it is in conflict with [Gridsome Remark Twitter](https://gridsome.org/plugins/gridsome-plugin-remark-twitter). Anyway embed option of Youtube's share button works.

- Added [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) to monitor the site
- Added [gridsome-plugin-remark-youtube](https://github.com/markhoney/gridsome-plugin-remark-youtube) to display youtube. Take note that there are two backticks!!!
- Changed footer with inspiration from [DAN VEGA Blog](https://www.danvega.dev/)
