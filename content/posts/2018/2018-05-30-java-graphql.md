The easiest way to get started is surprisingly based an example from [graphql-java-tools](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java-tools/tree/master/example)

graphql-java is a heavily coupled ecosystems, you have to start browsing from [graphql-java](https://github.com/graphql-java)

Confusing part is, there are two different sets of annotations implemented:

* [leangen/graphql-spqr](https://github.com/leangen/graphql-spqr) - GraphQL SPQR (GraphQL Schema Publisher & Query Resolver, pronounced like speaker) 
* [GraphQL Annotations for Java](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java-annotations) - This library offers an annotations-based syntax for GraphQL schema definition.

Do take note.
