Tools and utilities which I will install when I got a new laptop for development besides my usual IDE.

## Table of Contents

## The Must-Haves

### [FreeCommander](https://freecommander.com)

[FreeCommander](https://freecommander.com) is the Windows Explorer replacement which I will always install.<br>
Besides the dual pane, the file search is one of the best and accurate which I come across. Sometimes, with
[FreeCommander](https://freecommander.com) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), I can just go on
to edit Java source code.

### [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is the Windows Notepad replacement with the necessary color syntax required to see a lot of different types of file formats.
I seldom open Windows Notepad because of [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). Portable version available.

### [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)

[7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) is my default tool for opening zip and tar.gz files. Portable version available.

### [Cmder](https://cmder.net/)

[Cmder](https://cmder.net/) is the multi-tab Windows console replacement.
It is [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) plus [git-for-windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) bundled with all the Unix commands.

### [IranView](https://www.irfanview.com/)

[IranView](https://www.irfanview.com/) is used for screenshots and cropping and quick way to edit images.

### [Fork](https://git-fork.com/)

[Fork](https://git-fork.com/) is my first choice git client on Windows

## The Second Waves

### [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)

[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) is my quick and dirty way to do technical presentation. I used the [reveal-md, reveal.js on steroids!](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md)
to have a better experience in using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).

### [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) this is must-have for REST API development.

## Team Must-Haves

### [Gitbucket](https://gitbucket.github.io/)

I used to use [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/) as the go-to for intranet wiki, issues management alternative. Even since
I lay my hands on [Gitbucket](https://gitbucket.github.io/), it becomes my platform for intranet wiki and issues management alternative.
The only thing it is not good enough is actually the CI functionality.

### [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)

[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) is the default Continuous Integration tool I will use.

### [Nexus Repository OSS](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss)

[Nexus Repository OSS](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss) is the private maven repository manage.
Alternatively, I am going to explore using Git as the private maven repository.

## Deprecates

### [VNote](https://tamlok.github.io/vnote/)

[VNote]((https://tamlok.github.io/vnote/) is primarily used for editing Markdown files. I used this to edit markdown files against a git repository.

### [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)

[ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) is the multi-tab Windows console replacement.
Most of the time, I will use Maven to compile source code, this comes in very handy with the colors and maximized Windows.
Portable version available.

### [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/)

[TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) is my really really private personal wiki. Which to confess, I won't use at home :-)

### [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/)

[Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/) before I come across and actively using - [Gitbucket](https://gitbucket.github.io/)

## In the pipeline to try out...

I will always keep a look out of the different handy tools to use for development purpose:

- [SqlPad](http://rickbergfalk.github.io/sqlpad/) - Run SQL in your browser...
- [Lepton](https://github.com/hackjutsu/Lepton) - github snippet management
- [The Silver Searcher](https://geoff.greer.fm/ag/) or [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - code searching tool
- Exploring some Chrome Extensions from https://medium.freecodecamp.org/tools-i-wish-i-had-known-about-when-i-started-coding-57849efd9248,
  ColorZilla, CSS Peeper, Pesticide.
