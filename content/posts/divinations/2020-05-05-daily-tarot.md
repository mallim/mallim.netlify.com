## First thing on my mind

- dunno why I always get reverse cards...
- 不是又要花钱吧？

## Keywords

- frustrations and delays
- feel angry and that you are not getting anywhere
- financial meaning: overconfident about money, wasting funds, financial loss

## Tarot Video - Yes/No Spread

- [Yes No Tarot Spread](https://youtu.be/f5M8V2JEzRQ) - No spread. Go for 4 deck. 4 Ace = Yes. No Ace = No. 2 Ace = Maybe (towards No). 3 Ace = Maybe (towards Yes).

* [Simple Yes/No Tarot Spread](https://youtu.be/TJFYj_akbg4) and [A Unique Yes/No Answer Spread](https://youtu.be/WJvhO93L5UM) - 6 cards spread. cups + wands = yes, swords + pentacles = no, The Sun = Definite Yes and ignore the rest. The Moon = Definte No and ignore the rest.

* [Tarot Lesson - Mary Greer's Yes/No Method #2](https://youtu.be/SsxT0jUZ1V0) - 3 cards spread. left and right is 1, central is 2. Upright is Yes. Reversal is No. **Not recommend to interpret**

* [Tarot Lesson - Yes/No Questions Technique and Spread #1](https://youtu.be/BLCGQJE_sq8) - 5 cards spread. even is yes, odd is no, major is even. Doesn't cater for reversals.
