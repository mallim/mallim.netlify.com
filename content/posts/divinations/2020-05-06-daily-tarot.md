## First thing on my mind

- yet another reverse card...
- last working day?

## Keywords

- Bring resolution to conflicts with others through respectful communication.
- No need to react in an unseemly manner.
- Another continuation on yesterday's message? Can also suggest you are acting hastily, without thinking things through
