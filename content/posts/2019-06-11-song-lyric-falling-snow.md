> 演唱 Singer: 陸虎<br/> 作詞 Lyrics : 于正

輕輕，落在我掌心，<br/> _Gently, falling on my palm,_

靜靜，在掌中結冰。<br/> _Quitely, freezing within my hand._

相逢，是前世註定，<br/> _To meet, is a destiny from the past,_

痛並，把快樂嘗盡。<br/> _While we go through all the sweetness and sorrowness._

<hr/>

明明，話那麼寒心，<br/> _Obviously, your words are hurtful._

假裝，那只是叮嚀。<br/> _And yet, I am pretending it to be a friendly urge._

淚盡，也不能相信，<br/> _Even with no more tears, I am still in disbelief,_

此生，如紙般薄命。<br/> _This life, is as fragile as a paper._

<hr/>

我慢慢地聽，雪落下的聲音, <br/> _Slowly, I listen to the sound of the falling snow,_

閉著眼睛幻想它不會停，<br/> _Closing my eyes fantasizing that it will never stop,_

你沒辦法靠近，決不是太薄情，<br/> _You cannot get closer, and it's not because we are not for each other,_

只是貪戀窗外好風景。<br/> _It's just that I cannot leave my eyes off the beautiful things outside the window._

<hr/>

我慢慢地品，雪落下的聲音，<br/> _Slowly, I savour the sound of the falling snow,_

彷彿是你貼著我叫卿卿, <br/> _As if you crept up to me and whisper into my ears,_

睜開了眼睛，漫天的雪無情, <br/> _Alas I open my eyes, and all I can see is the snow flying aimlessly around me,_

誰來賠這一生的好光景. <br/> _Who can give me back this beautful moment again?_

<hr/>

明明，話那麼寒心， <br/> _Obviously, your words are hurtful._

假裝，那只是叮嚀。 <br/> _And yet I am pretending it to be a friendly urge._

淚盡，也不能相信， <br/> _Even with no more tears, I am still in disbelief,_

此生，如紙般薄命。<br/> _This life, is as fragile as a paper._

<hr/>

我慢慢地聽，雪落下的聲音， <br/> _Slowly I listen to the sound of the falling snow,_

閉著眼睛幻想它不會停，<br/> _Closing my eyes and fantasizing that it will never stop,_

你沒辦法靠近，決不是太薄情，<br/> _You cannot get closer, and it's not because we are not for each other,_

只是貪戀窗外好風景。<br/> _It's just that I cannot leave my eyes off the beautiful things outside the window._

<hr/>

我慢慢地品，雪落下的聲音，<br/> _Slowly, I savour the sound of the falling snow,_

彷彿是你貼著我叫卿卿，<br/> _As if you crept up to me and whisper into my ears,_

睜開了眼睛，漫天的雪無情 <br/> _Alas I open my eyes, and all I can see is the snow flying aimlessly around me,_

誰來賠這一生的好光景？ <br/> _Who can give me back this beautful moment again?_
